This project is an experimentation which has stopped. This project is published for reference/research only. It is not only maintained any longer! Go to the above links to see a working Chess Engine written in Clojure.



# clj-cl-chess

Experiment with Core.logic. Some of the move have been modilized but other were hard to map onto core.logic. This is put on hold for the moment. I'm now implementing a solution in pure Clojure.

Core.logic can be magic when the problem domain is correctly mapped but finding the correct domain representation is not always straightfoward.

Please let me know if you find a chess engine representation with Corelogic which matches the beauty of the Sudoku implementation. Hopefully my might work might give you an initial step so you can find a complete path to the solution.
